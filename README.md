- The assignment was to create a news feed site with blog posts.

The list of criterias for this assignment was:

-> Published date
-> Like counter (the number of likes a news feed item has received)



Follow the instructions below to get started:

1, Clone this repository (locally) to your desktop
2, Launch mamP on your computer (if you dont have mamP, go to and download it.)
3, Locate the cloned directory in mamP
4, Open up the browser and enter this (if you are on mac) "localhost:8888" or (if you are on windows, depending on open ports) "http://localhost:8888"
